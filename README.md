# ----- Project Description -----
This is something you probably don't need, but will enrich your life and make using the Task Manager easier anyway :D

The task manager is a very versatile tool through which we can manage almost all of the windows processes.
Opening the Task Manager through keyboard and navigating through it using the mouse is pretty easy and simplicity itself, but sometimes we take longer to find a process in the long list of processes, either due to weird names, or some different sorting method applied to the processes table (such as sort by memory Usage, when all we really want to do is just find the specific process by name and maybe end it).

This project is aimed at supercharging our productivity with Task Manager and make it easier to use using voice commands.

# ----- Features (WIP) -----
- Easily check if a process from a specific program is running or not
- End a process
- Set process priority
- Make and use aliases for processes with absurd names for ease of working with them

All via voice commands and without opening the Task Manager :D

# Eventually
Merge it with my curated personal artificial assistant.
